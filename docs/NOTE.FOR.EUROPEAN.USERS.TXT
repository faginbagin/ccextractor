I regularly get emails from European users reporting that 
ccextractor doesn't work with their recordings.

ccextractor (for now) only extract closed captions. This refers
to the TECHNICAL standard that US TV uses to carry subtitles. 

Whether you believe that teletext subtitles are closed captions
or not is not important: They don't follow EIA-608 (which is
the official document that describes closed captions in 
the USA) so ccextractor can't help.

By the way I am from Europe (and live here, too) so I feel
your pain. Just don't get annoyed when I say that Europe
doesn't have closed captions. Of course we have subtitles
(and we call them subtitles, not closed captions), they just
use a different standard.

Because I need English subtitles for American TV shows I wrote
a NTSC (American TV standard) closed caption extractor.

I am interested in writing a proper tool to extract subtitles
from BBC and other British stations (it IS possible to extract
subtitles already with Project-X but I hear the whole process
is a pain).

If you have the required hardware (capture card for example),
time, patience, and willingness to provide capture samples 
contact me.
